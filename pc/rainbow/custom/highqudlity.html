      <p>When you purchase a pair of glasses, you want the lenses to be designed to improve your vision, not hinder it. They should protect your eyes, reduce eye strain and help you see more clearly. This is best achieved through high-grade lenses and special coatings.</p>
      <p>Glasses Gallery offers high quality lenses for all glasses from any brands for FREE. Theses lenses offer UV protection and resist daily impact. They are also lightweight, scratch resistant, and easy to clean.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Thin lenses:</strong>&nbsp;These lenses offer not only thin and lightweight comfort, but also style that meets your aesthetics.
        <br>
        <strong>Impact resistant coating:</strong>&nbsp;offers you the desired safety for your active daily life.
        <br>
        <strong>Anti-reflective coating:</strong>&nbsp;improves vision, reduces eye strain and makes your eyeglasses look more attractive. The coating virtually eliminates reflections from the front and back surfaces of your eyeglass.
        <br>
        <strong>Scratch-resistant coating:</strong>&nbsp;minimize scratches on the lens surface and extend the life of the lenses. Kids' lenses, especially, benefit from a scratch-resistant hard coat for greater durability.
        <br>
        <strong>UV Block:</strong>&nbsp;UVA/B protection to safeguard your eyes from harmful UV rays.
        <br>
        <strong>Easy-to-clean convenience:</strong>&nbsp;Lenses are suitable for daily use with our premium super hydrophobic coating, the lenses will be less likely to get dirty or retain your fingerprints.</p>
      <p>Many other eyewear stores will charge separately for all the above these valuable features, but Glasses Gallery includes these on every qualified pair for FREE. To us, these are the necessities but not add-ons that should cost extra.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>FDA Marking:</strong>&nbsp;certifying that our lenses can be used to professionally serve your optical needs.</p>
